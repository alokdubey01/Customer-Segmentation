# Customer Segmentation

The goal of customer segmentation is to analyze customer data to identify clusters of similar customers, so that a business can then better target its marketing and promotional efforts to those groups. This typically involves using data such as customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and other related information to identify similarities and differences between customers. By understanding customer segments, a business can use more targeted messaging, pricing, and products to appeal to those customers. This can result in higher customer satisfaction, improved customer loyalty, and ultimately, increased profits.
